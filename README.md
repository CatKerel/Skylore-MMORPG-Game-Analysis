# Guild Activity Analysis in a Mobile MMORPG

This project focuses on analyzing the activity of guilds in a mobile MMORPG game. Using clustering algorithms, guilds are categorized based on their activity levels (e.g., empty, inactive, etc.), and various hypotheses are tested through A/B testing.

## Files

- **Skylore_TA_Kiselev.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis.
- **Skylore_TA_Kiselev.pdf**: PDF version of the main notebook for easier viewing.
- **Data Files**: CSV files with relevant data for guild activity analysis, including:
  - `guild_data.csv`
  - `guild_clusters.csv`
  - `guild_merged.csv`
  - Other supporting data files (`data.csv`, `energy.csv`, `payers.csv`, etc.)

## Project Overview

1. **Clustering Analysis**: Guilds are clustered based on activity metrics, allowing for classification into categories (e.g., inactive, low activity).
2. **A/B Testing**: Various hypotheses about guild activity and player behavior are tested using A/B tests to draw insights on engagement.
